```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All site-wide configuration is managed in `src/consts.ts`.

### Metadata

The `metadata` object contains all the SEO and general site information.

```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: "Astro starter theme with Tailwind CSS",
  description: "A starter theme for Astro project with Tailwind CSS...",
  keywords: "Astro, starter, theme, basics, tutorial, example",
  robots: "index, follow",
  author: "Your Name",
  image: "/images/site-image.jpg",
  type: "website",
};
```

### Site Configuration

The `config` object contains settings related to deployment and content.

```typescript
export const config = {
  url: "https://mnyorba.github.io/",
  base: "/astro-starter",
  postsPerPage: 10,
};
```

-   `url`: Your site's deploy URL.
-   `base`: The base path of your site (e.g., `/blog`).
-   `postsPerPage`: Number of posts to display per page in the blog index.

### Pagination

Blog pagination is implemented with dynamic routes (`/blog/2/`, `/blog/3/`, etc.) and a reusable pagination component.  
You can set the number of posts per page in `config.postsPerPage` in `src/consts.ts`.

### Table of Contents

The theme uses `remark-toc` to automatically generate a table of contents for your markdown and MDX files.
To add a TOC to a post, simply add a heading with the text `Table of Contents` where you want the TOC to appear. The plugin will then generate a TOC with a maximum heading depth of 3.

For example:
```markdown
## Table of Contents
```

### Localization

Locale and date formatting are configured globally in `src/consts.ts` under the `locale` object.  
Change `locale.default` and `locale.date` to set your preferred language and date format for the entire site.

### Analytics

Analytics settings are managed in the `analytics` object in `src/consts.ts`.  
By default, Google Tag Manager is integrated via [@astrojs/partytown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/) for better performance.

```typescript
export const analytics = {
  google: {
    id: "GTM-XXXXXXX" // Your Google Tag Manager ID
  }
}
```

The ID is automatically injected into the analytics script in `src/components/common/Analytics.astro`.  
To enable analytics, simply set your GTM or Google Analytics ID in `consts.ts` ‚Äî no need to edit component code.

**How it works:**
- The theme uses [@astrojs/partytown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/) to offload analytics scripts to a web worker, improving site performance.
- The `<Analytics />` component is included in the `<head>` of every page.
- You can use Google Tag Manager or Google Analytics by specifying the correct ID.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project can be deployed to a variety of platforms.

- **GitHub Pages**: 
  A pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow is included to build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages. Make sure to set the `site` and `base` properties in `astro.config.mjs` correctly for your repository. You can trigger the workflow manually from the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.

- **Vercel & Netlify**: 
  Deploying to Vercel and Netlify is a zero-configuration process. Connect your GitHub repository and the platforms will automatically detect and build your Astro site.

- **Other Platforms**: Astro supports deployment to many other platforms like AWS, Cloudflare Pages, and more. Check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for more information.
